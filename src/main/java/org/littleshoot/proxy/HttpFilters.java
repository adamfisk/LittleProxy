/**
 * <p>
 * Interface for objects that filter {@link HttpObject}s, including both
 * requests and responses, and informs of different steps in request/response.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Multiple methods are defined, corresponding to different steps in the request
 * processing lifecycle. Some of these methods is given the current object
 * (request, response or chunk) and is allowed to modify it in place. Others
 * provide a notification of when specific operations happen (i.e. connection in
 * queue, DNS resolution, SSL handshaking and so forth).
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Because HTTP transfers can be chunked, for any given request or response, the
 * filter methods that can modify request/response in place may be called
 * multiple times, once for the initial {@link HttpRequest} or
 * {@link HttpResponse}, and once for each subsequent {@link HttpContent}. The
 * last chunk will always be a {@link LastHttpContent} and can be checked for
 * being last using {@link ProxyUtils#isLastChunk(HttpObject)}.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * {@link HttpFiltersSource#getMaximumRequestBufferSizeInBytes()} and
 * {@link HttpFiltersSource#getMaximumResponseBufferSizeInBytes()} can be used
 * to instruct the proxy to buffer the {@link HttpObject}s sent to all of its
 * request/response filters, in which case it will buffer up to the specified
 * limit and then send either complete {@link HttpRequest}s or
 * {@link HttpResponse}s to the filter methods. When buffering, if the proxy
 * receives more data than fits in the specified maximum bytes to buffer, the
 * proxy will stop processing the request and respond with a 502 Bad Gateway
 * error.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * A new instance of {@link HttpFilters} is created for each request, so these
 * objects can be stateful.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * To monitor (and time measure?) the different steps the request/response goes
 * through, many informative methods are provided. Those steps are reported in
 * the following order:
 * <ol>
 * <li>clientToProxyRequest</li>
 * <li>proxyToServerConnectionQueued</li>
 * <li>proxyToServerResolutionStarted</li>
 * <li>proxyToServerResolutionSucceeded</li>
 * <li>proxyToServerRequest (can be multiple if chunked)</li>
 * <li>proxyToServerConnectionStarted</li>
 * <li>proxyToServerConnectionFailed (if connection couldn't be established)</li>
 * <li>proxyToServerConnectionSSLHandshakeStarted (only if HTTPS required)</li>
 * <li>proxyToServerConnectionSucceeded</li>
 * <li>proxyToServerRequestSending</li>
 * <li>proxyToServerRequestSent</li>
 * <li>serverToProxyResponseReceiving</li>
 * <li>serverToProxyResponse (can be multiple if chuncked)</li>
 * <li>serverToProxyResponseReceived</li>
 * <li>proxyToClientResponse</li>
 * </ol>
 * </p>
